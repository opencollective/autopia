# Autopia

“You cannot buy the revolution.\
You cannot make the revolution.\
You can only be the revolution.\
It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere.”\
― Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed

Autopia is an open-source social network emerging from co-created microfestivals and other real-life gatherings.
